### 4. Tutorial Text Updated
- ‚úÖ Changed from "mouse, gestures, calibration" to "mouse navigation, component inspection, and AI assistance"
- ‚úÖ Updated title from "Sentry AI Holographic Monitor" to "BMW Fleet Monitor"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Completed / Remaining Work

### JavaScript Gesture Code
Due to the extensive and deeply integrated nature of the gesture control code (~600+ lines), there are still gesture-related code fragments remaining in the JavaScript section. These include:

**Known Remaining Sections:**
1. **Lines 1041-1457** (approximately): Various gesture handler functions including:
   - `gestureCursor` elements and styling
   - `reticle` elements
   - Calibration functions (`startCalibration`, `endCalibration`, `calibSamples`)
   - `handleSingleHand` function
   - Gesture configuration objects (`gestureConfig`)
   - Pinch detection logic
   - Hand tracking variables
   - Audio feedback functions for gesture clicks

2. **Event Listeners** (around line 1700+): Need to clean up:
   - Remove `controlMode` variable checks
   - Remove keyboard listeners for gesture keys (G, C, T, I, Z, brackets, etc.)
   - Simplify mouse event listeners (remove `if (controlMode === 'mouse')` checks)

3. **updateHover Function**: Contains `if (controlMode === 'gesture')` checks that need to be removed

## üîß Manual Steps Required

To complete the gesture removal, the following steps should be done:

### Step 1: Remove Remaining Gesture JavaScript
The file currently has gesture code between "// --- MOUSE CONTROLS ---" and "// --- INTERACTION & ANIMATION ---" sections. This entire block should be removed, keeping only:
- The "// --- MOUSE CONTROLS ---" comment
- The "// --- INTERACTION & ANIMATION ---" section which starts with `const raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();`

### Step 2: Clean Up Event Listeners
In the EVENT LISTENERS section (around line 1700+):
- Remove the `controlMode` variable entirely
- Change `window.addEventListener('pointermove', (e) => { if (controlMode === 'mouse') onPointerMove(e); });` to just `window.addEventListener('pointermove', onPointerMove);`
- Change `window.addEventListener('click', (e) => { if (controlMode === 'mouse') onPointerClick(e); });` to just `window.addEventListener('click', onPointerClick);`

### Step 3: Update Keyboard Event Listener
Remove all gesture-related key handlers (G, C, T, I, Z, brackets, comma, period, 0) and keep only:
- F (vehicle selector toggle)
- D (debug anchors toggle)
- R (reset camera)
- Esc (close overlays)
- Arrow keys (tutorial navigation if applicable)

### Step 4: Clean updateHover Function
Remove the check for `if (controlMode === 'gesture')` and keep only the mouse/pointer hover logic

### Step 5: Remove Calibration Overlay
If there's a `calibration-overlay` div in the HTML (not yet found), remove it.

### Step 6: Test
After manual cleanup:
1. Restart server: `npm start`
2. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Verify:
   - No console errors about missing elements
   - Mouse controls work (hover, click on component markers)
   - Camera zoom slider works
   - Vehicle selector works (press F)
   - No gesture-related UI elements visible

## üìù Notes

- The gesture control system was deeply integrated with the mouse control system, sharing many functions and state variables
- The `controlMode` variable was used throughout to switch between mouse and gesture modes
- Complete removal requires careful extraction to avoid breaking mouse controls
- The camera zoom slider should be kept as it controls the 3D view distance (not related to gesture/webcam)

## Alternative Approach

If manual cleanup is too complex, consider:
1. Backup the current `public/index.html`
2. Create a clean version with only:
   - HTML structure (keep vehicle selector, info panel, help panel, AI chat, camera zoom slider)
   - Three.js scene setup
   - GLTF model loading
   - Mouse interaction only (pointer move, click, hover)
   - Keyboard shortcuts (F, D, R, Esc only)
   - Render loop and animation
3. Copy over the working sections from the backed-up version

This would ensure a clean codebase without remnants of gesture code.
