The problem involves microfractures in the primary seal and structural anomalies in the canopy frame. These issues compromise the pressurization integrity of the aircraft, rendering it non-mission capable.\n\n#### **Root Cause Analysis**\n1. **Material Fatigue:** Repeated pressurization cycles have caused stress accumulation in the canopy frame.\n2. **Thermal Cycling:** Exposure to extreme temperature variations during flight operations has led to micro-cracking in the composite material.\n3. **Aerodynamic Load:** The canopy's location experiences significant aerodynamic forces, exacerbating the microfractures.\n4. **Manufacturing Tolerance:** Historical records suggest the canopy frame was manufactured at the upper limit of tolerance, making it more susceptible to stress.\n\n#### **Identified Fix**\n1. **Material R"}
